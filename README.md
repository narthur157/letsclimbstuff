Small project to practice React.

###Setup

`npm install`
`npm run dev` starts the node server as well as the webpack-dev server

Open http://localhost:8080

MVP:

List of climbing locations each with a queue of people looking to climb. Current solutions for this problem are cumbersome, slow, and require too much planning. Goal: be able to show up to crag and group up without prior planning

Basic CRUD app

C - Add a climber, which is just a name, description, and location. 
R - View list of climbers, as grouped by location
U - Add climbers
D - Remove climbers who have been in the list too long, or who already found a group

Design - Use material design. Mobile oriented. 

Stack - Webpack w/ React, fetch, HTML5 location services
